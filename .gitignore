Should I add Gitignore repository?


    They should almost always be included, as their purpose is to ignore "output" files (compiled binaries, log files) which 
    are going to be generated by anybody working with a clone of your project
    gitignore files within the repository to ignore files that only appear for you, such as editor-specific swap files.
